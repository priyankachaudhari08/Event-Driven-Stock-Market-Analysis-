Executive Summary:

This analysis commenced with a macroscopic examination of major financial markets, specifically the Nasdaq and NYSE, and the broad market index S&P 500. An initial assessment segmented these markets into various sectors, leading to a focused analysis on the Technology sector within the Nasdaq market due to its significant impact potential.

Market Behavior and Index Analysis
Utilizing the S&P 500 as a representative benchmark, the study conducted a comprehensive review of annual, quarterly, and historical trends. This provided a foundational understanding of general market behaviors and helped to contextualize fluctuations within the broader economic landscape.

Feature engineering with stability metrics
A primary objective of this was to integrate stability metrics for the stocks which would be deemed suitable for novice investors. The stability assessment incorporated several metrics, including Standard Deviation, Average True Range (ATR), daily and average volume, Relative Volume Traded, and Beta. These indicators were instrumental in determining stocks that offer safety amidst market volatility.

Microscopic Focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL)
The analysis narrowed further to a microscopic examination of Apple Inc. (AAPL), chosen for its prominence within the Technology sector and its significant market activity. This part of the project was characterized as event-driven analysis, centering around the COVID-19 period to evaluate the stock's performance pre-, during, and post-pandemic. Techniques such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands were employed to provide detailed insights into the stockâ€™s behavior during these times.

Sentiment Analysis Through Social Media
An innovative aspect of this study involved collecting Twitter data to perform an extended sentiment analysis. This aimed to quantify the influence of social media sentiment on stock market movements, particularly how public perception as reflected through social media platforms correlates with stock price fluctuations.

Predictive Modeling
For an extension of this project, a logistic regression model was developed to predict the opening price of stocks. This predictive model is intended to empower users with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed buy or sell decisions based on predicted market movements.
